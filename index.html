  <h2>Why I would like to visit Zanzibar, Tanzanian<h2>

  <ul>
    <li>White sand beachs</li>
    <li>Friendly locals</li>
    <li>Tasty local food</li>
    <li>East Africa History</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have always had the dream to see Zanzibar, its a very romatic place.
    I long to hear the locals speak swahili in the streets, at the markets
    and shops.I long to hear hear the swahili beats, on the streets, at the
    bar, cafe shops, resturants and in the clubs</p>

  <p>Zanzibar is a true paradise in Africa, the breeze awaits me.</p>
